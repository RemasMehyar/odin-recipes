     <h3>Intsructions : </h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil 
            <br>in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts 
            <br>to a plate and set aside. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining 
                <br>in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 
                <br>5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, 
                <br>and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute 
                <br>while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and  
                <br>1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. 
                    <br>Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to 
                    <br>coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 
                    <br>1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink 
                        <br>in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
                        <br> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
                        <br> at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve. </li>
