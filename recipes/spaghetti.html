        <ol>
            <li>Fill large Dutch oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Separate pasta with tongs a few times during first 2 minutes of cooking. This will ensure spaghetti do not stick together.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook pasta uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally. 
                <br>Taste for doneness while cooking. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to tasty pasta is firm cooked pasta. 
                <br>Drain spaghetti in a colander.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Return pot to medium heat and add olive oil, 4 garlic cloves and oregano. Turn off 
                <br>the heat. Stir constantly for 20 seconds.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Add drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, black pepper and 1 garlic 
                <br>clove. Stir gently until warmed through.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately. This is the best cheap and quite healthy spaghetti I have ever had anywhere!</li>
